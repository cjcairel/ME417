I used Visual Studio code for the assignment and I tried to mimic the same section formatting as the MATLAB assignments. 

Many of the files import functions from a file called "Z_Every_Function"
      That File will be at the bottom of the assignment folder if sorted alphabetically. 
      It contains all of the helper functions that each assignment file calls or may call.
      I made it that way so that I didn't need to paste every single function on top of the last in order to run them

      "Z_Every_Function" needs to be moved into the current assignment folder so that the import can run 
      - I did not feel like making different ones for each folder


This was created much later than it should have because I forgot that you had said to make a repository for our code to submit assignments until a classmate reminded me. I also have not been felling well 
and could not make it into class as much for any other reminders.
